    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Greetings from Melbourne, Australia! Welcome to my official webpage, where I proudly showcase my dual passions for machine learning and sports. Over the past several years, my professional journey has revolved around cultivating trust in the outcomes of machine learning, recognizing the pivotal role trust plays in shaping our world.

In my role within the industry, I have undertaken diverse projects, such as meticulously auditing generative language models for factual accuracy, unraveling the intricacies of object detection models' attention at scale, and adeptly classifying policy-violating responses from web assistants for effective filtration. These endeavors represent just a glimpse into my commitment to ensuring the reliability and integrity of machine learning processes.

My academic journey led me to pursue a Ph.D. at the esteemed University of Melbourne, where I had the privilege of collaborating with distinguished professors, including Prof. Chris Leckie, Prof. Lars Kulik, and Prof. Jame Bezdeck from Brown University, USA. My doctoral research seamlessly merged my passion for weight training with the world of machine learning, resulting in the creation of the first personalized wearable device capable of detecting, tracking, and evaluating weight training activities in real-time. A captivating demonstration of this groundbreaking project can be explored here!

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Master's in Computer Science from the University of Melbourne and completed my Bachelor's degree at Shiraz University, Iran.

Beyond the realm of academia and technology, I am an avid reader with an insatiable curiosity about the quantum world. Whether delving into the intricacies of computing or exploring the mechanics of the universe, I find solace and inspiration in the pages of my favorite books.

Thank you for visiting, and I invite you to explore the intersection of my professional expertise and personal interests on this platform.

  <h1>Time Series Analysis with Curvature-Based Representation</h1>
	<p>Addressing fundamental problems in time series analysis, the paper introduces a representation of time series using differential geometric properties of curves. Fourier analysis of this representation leads to a vector space where each time series is uniquely defined by a vector.</p>

  <p>The research focuses on two key problems: computing a prototype from a given set of time series and comparing a pair of time series. To demonstrate effectiveness, K-Means clustering and Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC) tasks are employed in time series analysis.</p>

  <p>The proposed method has implications in various applications, including anomaly detection, database retrieval, generating synthetic time series data, designing loss functions for optimization problems, and preserving privacy in group representations.</p>

  <p>Overall, the paper provides a novel approach to time series analysis, leveraging curvature-based representation and demonstrating its efficacy in solving core problems in the field.</p>
